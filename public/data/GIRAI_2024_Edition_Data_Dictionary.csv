"(*) Data was collected for Chinese Taipei (commonly referred to as Taiwan) and the West Bank, which is under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. No data collection took place in Gaza. We recognize that these are, at the time of writing, disputed jurisdictions.",,,,,
"Note: In the Thematic Area ""International Cooperation"" for Chad, the country was initially awarded 1 point under the Government actions pillar because it did not have a framework in place, and the identified government action was classified as ""Draft frameworks."" However, after the index scores were published, we identified an error in this classification. The correct classification should have been ""Establishing partnerships and collaborations,"" which would correspond to a score of 0.9 points for the Government actions pillar. Although the action type was corrected post-publication, no adjustments were made to the published scores.",,,,,
